sort photos helps to organize photos taken on your Phone or smart camera.
It reads the exif data (date and location) of each Foto
and builds a new folder structure to get a better overview of what you've experience 
in the last few years.  

Photos without exif date will be estiamted by the modification date.
Unfortunately most messengers (especially Whatsapp) cut most data to reduce the traffic 
when you share images.
